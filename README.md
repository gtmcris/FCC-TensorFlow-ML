In this notebook, I worked on the "Cat and Dog Image Classifier" project as part of freeCodeCamp's Machine Learning with Python curriculum. The goal was to build a model that can classify images as either cats or dogs. To enhance the dataset, I employed the Image Data Generator to apply various augmentations such as horizontal and vertical flipping, zooming, and shifting both vertically and horizontally. For the classification task, I used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

This project has enabled me to have an effective understanding of using Neural Networks for image classification problems.
Feel free to explore the notebook and dive into the learning process! üê± üê∂
